# Building the Collective

The Pyscript Collective is about people helping people, but it also produces 3 software artifacts:

- Well-maintained example apps
- A website
- An installable package to locally run (and tinker with) the examples

These docs describe the writing of the repository for this software.
It's done as "Diary Driven Development": one step at a time, describe the "why", then explain the what.

At each step:

- Work on the branch
- Write docs for the problem being solved
- Notes on the solution
- Open questions
- Make a commit that clearly identifies the step.

You can then "follow along" so to speak by looking at each commit.
This section covers each step in the prototype.
