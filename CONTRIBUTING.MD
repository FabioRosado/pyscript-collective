# Contributing to PyScript

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the PyScript Collective!

This file will guide you through how to make your first community contribution, if you're looking for contributing to PyScript Core, please head over to [this](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript) repository.

The intention set for this repository is for it to be a place that's built by the community to serve the community. We want contributors to take ownership on tasks like onboarding new folks, co-maintaining examples and keeping them and enriching this repository with their own perspectives. It's a space for users and contributors to discuss on how the community should be shaped.
